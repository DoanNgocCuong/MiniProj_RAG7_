# Bug Report: Missing Method in DataIngestion Class

## Issue Description
The application failed with an `AttributeError` when trying to call the method `load_and_preprocess_faq_data()` which didn't exist in the `DataIngestion` class.

## Error Message
```
AttributeError: 'DataIngestion' object has no attribute 'load_and_preprocess_faq_data'
```

## Root Cause
The `DataIngestion` class had two separate methods:
- `load_faq_data()`
- `preprocess_faq_data()`

But the code in `main.py` was trying to call a single method `load_and_preprocess_faq_data()` which didn't exist. This was likely due to a refactoring where the method was split but not all references were updated.

## Solution Implemented
Added a new method `load_and_preprocess_faq_data()` to the `DataIngestion` class that combines the functionality of both existing methods:

```python
@staticmethod
def load_and_preprocess_faq_data(file_path: str = "data/TinhNangApp.json") -> List[Document]:
    """Load and preprocess FAQ data in one step"""
    documents = DataIngestion.load_faq_data(file_path)
    return DataIngestion.preprocess_faq_data(documents)
```

## Testing
The fix was verified by:
1. Running the application again
2. Confirming that the `AttributeError` no longer occurs
3. Verifying that the data loading and preprocessing works as expected

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. When refactoring code, ensure all references are updated
2. Use static type checking to catch missing methods
3. Maintain comprehensive test coverage
4. Document method changes in the changelog
