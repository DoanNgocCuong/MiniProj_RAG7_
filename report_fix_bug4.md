# Bug Report: Method Name Mismatch in Embedding Class

## Issue Description
The application failed with an `AttributeError` due to a method name mismatch between the `Embedding` class implementation and its usage in `main.py`.

## Error Message
```
AttributeError: 'Embedding' object has no attribute 'create_vector_db'. Did you mean: 'create_vectordb'?
```

## Root Cause
There was an inconsistency in method naming:
- In `main.py`, the code called `create_vector_db()`
- In `embedder.py`, the method was named `create_vectordb()`

This type of error typically occurs when:
1. Method names are changed during refactoring
2. Inconsistent naming conventions are used
3. Documentation and implementation get out of sync

## Solution Implemented
Updated the method name in `embedder.py` to match the call in `main.py`:

```python
def create_vector_db(self, documents: List[Document]) -> Chroma:
    """Create vector database with error handling"""
    try:
        embeddings = self.create_embeddings()
        return Chroma.from_documents(
            documents=documents,
            embedding=embeddings,
            persist_directory="./chroma_db"
        )
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to create vector database: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

## Testing
The fix was verified by:
1. Running the application again
2. Confirming that the `AttributeError` no longer occurs
3. Verifying that the vector database creation works as expected

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase
2. Document method names and their purposes
3. Use IDE features to detect method name changes
4. Implement unit tests to catch method name mismatches
5. Consider using type checking to catch such errors at compile time

## Additional Notes
This bug highlights the importance of:
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper documentation
- Code review processes
- Automated testing
- IDE tooling usage
